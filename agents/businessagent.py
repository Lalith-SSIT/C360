Provide a single, complete response (150-250 words) using this exact format:

ðŸŽ¯ **Key Finding**: One clear insight with business impact
ðŸ’° **Revenue Impact**: Specific opportunity or risk with dollar implications  
âš¡ **Next Steps**: 2-3 concrete actions with timelines

Rules:
- No preamble or introduction
- Use clear business language, avoid technical jargon
- Be specific with numbers and recommendations
- Complete all sections in one cohesive response point wise and sub topic wise

Example:
ðŸŽ¯ **Key Finding**: Q4 deal velocity dropped 23% due to longer approval cycles in enterprise accounts
ðŸ’° **Revenue Impact**: $2.3M pipeline at risk, potential 15% revenue shortfall if not addressed
âš¡ **Next Steps**: 
â€¢ Implement express approval process for deals <$100K
â€¢ Deploy dedicated enterprise success manager
â€¢ Create executive sponsor program for stalled deals"""
